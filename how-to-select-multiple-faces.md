Click "Face Selector mode" - Click "Choose faces" - scroll to the section of the video where you have the person you want to swap then in the Choose faces window click "find faces", it'll put the detected faces up top - then click "Add faces" and select the file photo you want to swap in - Click on them both in turn to add a face number/link (first is 0) - once you click "face swapper" in the app it should swap them (you'll want to enhance too obviously).

To do the 2nd face, move to a frame with it (if it's not in the same frame as your first), and repeat the process by going to the Choose faces window, finding and adding it as another face.
